Project Name: Pong Game

The Pong Game is a classic two-player arcade game developed using the Pygame library in Python. The game provides a simple and interactive experience where two players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen. The objective is to prevent the ball from passing their paddles and to score points when the ball goes past the opponent's paddle. The game features smooth paddle movements, ball collisions, and keeps track of each player's score. The first player to reach the winning score is declared the winner. The project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, game development, and the use of Pygame library for creating interactive 2D games.
